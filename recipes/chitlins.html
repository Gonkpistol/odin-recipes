        Let's get started with the ingredients one will need in order to
        manifest this delicious southern comfort cuisine:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <ul>
          <li>10 pounds frozen chitterlings, thawed and cleaned</li>
          <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Preparation</h2>

      <p>
        Woah there big hoss! Eating peices of pig pooper ain't to be taken
        lightly. We want to ensure we are cleaning and handling the chitterlings
        properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soak chitterlings in cold water throughout the cleaning stage. Each
        chitterling should be examined and run under cold water and all foreign
        materials should be removed and discarded. Chitterlings should retain
        some fat, so be careful to leave some on. After each chitterling has
        been cleaned, soak in two cold water baths for a few minutes. The second
        water bath should be clearer. If not, soak in one more bath. Be sure to
        wash any surfaces with a bleach-based sanitizer and your hands
        thoroughly with soap to avoid contamination while handling raw
        chitterlings.
      </p>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <p>
        <em>"Let's make this shit!"</em> - our chitlins at one point probably
      </p>
      <p>Here are the steps we want to follow to bring this dish to life:</p>
      <div class="list">
        <ol>
          <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
          <li>
            Place cleaned chitterlings in a 6-quart pot and cover with cold
            water.
          </li>
          <li>

            red pepper flakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simmer until chitterlings are clear to white in color and reach
            desired tenderness, 3 to 4 hours.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
