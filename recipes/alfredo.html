    <p>
      To make chicken alfredo, we are going to need the following ingredients:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>pinch of salt and ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 (16 ounce) packages spaghetti</li>
      <li>4 (15 ounce) jars Alfredo sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped onion</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups shredded Parmesan cheese (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 cups chopped broccoli (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>Here are the steps we will want to follow to bring the dish together:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
      <li>
        Season chicken with a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet
        over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the
        center and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
        bite, 8 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, add Alfredo sauce to the chicken; season to taste with
        Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion, basil, salt, black pepper,
        onion powder, and cayenne.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring to a simmer; stir in Parmesan cheese. Cook mixture until cheese is
        melted and you are able to lift a spoon out of the sauce without cheese
        hanging onto it, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below
        the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover,
        and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Add broccoli to sauce.</li>
      <li>
        Drain cooked pasta. Scoop into individual serving bowls and pour sauce
        on top.
      </li>
    </ol>
